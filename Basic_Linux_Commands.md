# **Basic Linux Commands**

## What is Linux?

Linux is an open-source operating system widely used for both personal and enterprise computing. It’s favored by developers and system administrators for its stability, security, and versatility.

To start using Linux, you can execute commands in the **Terminal**—a command-line interface that allows you to communicate with the operating system. Learning basic Linux commands is straightforward and can greatly enhance your productivity.

## How to Write Commands

Commands are typed in the **Terminal**. Simply open the terminal on your Linux machine (or use a tool like SSH to access a remote system) and type your commands. It's a simple and effective way to perform a wide range of tasks, from navigating directories to manipulating files and data.

## Flags in Linux

Flags (also known as **options** or **parameters**) modify the behavior of a command. They are usually prefixed by a hyphen (`-`) for single-letter flags or double hyphens (`--`) for full-word options. For example, in the command `ls -l`, the `-l` flag tells the system to display a detailed list of files and directories.

### 1. **echo**

The `echo` command outputs the text you provide to the terminal.

**Usage:**
```bash
echo "Hello, World!"
```

**Output:**
```
Hello, World!
```

**Explanation:**  
The `echo` command is used to display a line of text or a variable's value. In real life, you could use this command to quickly output messages or to check the values of variables in scripts.
